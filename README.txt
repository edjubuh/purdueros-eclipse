PROS is a lightweight and fast alternative operating system for the VEX Cortex Microcontroller. It features multitasking, low-level control, and Wiring compatible functions to harness the full power of the Cortex. With a real-time kernel based on FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org ) and a development environment built on Eclipse CDT (http://www.eclipse.org/ ), PROS uses proven software to increase the reliability and usability of the VEX development system across all three major computing platforms.

PROS is available for both 32- and 64- bit systems. Please check the Files tab to download the correct version for your system,

PROS is currently under active development to make it usable for VEX high school and middle school teams. PROS is intended for advanced VEX users seeking to move beyond competing environments.

Eclipse and FreeRTOS have their own licensing agreements. Please see http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html  and http://www.freertos.org/a00114.html  for details.
